# Task 2: Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

This task is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
In this task, I worked on visualizing various aspects of a student dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

---

## Dataset:
The dataset contains student demographic and academic information such as gender, age, education level, scores, and course interest.

---

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Key Visualizations Created:

1. **Bar Chart** – Showing the number of students by gender  
2. **Pie Chart** – Distribution of interest in data science  
3. **Line Plot** – Age vs. Scores trend  
4. **Count Plot** – Education level of students  
5. **Scatter Plot** – Relationship between age and scores  
6. **Custom Color Themes** – For better presentation

## Conclusion:
The visualizations provided valuable insights into student demographics, their interest in data science, and academic performance. These plots helped identify patterns and relationships among different variables.
