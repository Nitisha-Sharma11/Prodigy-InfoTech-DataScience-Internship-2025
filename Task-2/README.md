## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Titanic Dataset

This task is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to passenger survival.

---

### Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

---

### Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

---

### Key Steps Performed

#### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
- Converted data types and dropped irrelevant columns.

#### Univariate Analysis
- Count plot of survival status.
- Bar chart of passengers by class and gender.
- Histogram of age distribution.

#### Multivariate Analysis
- Heatmap showing correlation between numerical variables.
- Grouped visualizations to compare survival by class, gender, and embarkation point.

### Insights

- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 2nd or 3rd class.
- Most passengers embarked from Southampton.
- Younger passengers (especially children under 10) had higher chances of survival.

### Conclusion

This EDA revealed strong correlations between survival and features like gender, passenger class, and age. The Titanic dataset remains a great resource for practicing data analysis and understanding real-world patterns.
