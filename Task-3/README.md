# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Heart Disease Dataset

This task is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
In this task, I performed a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to uncover meaningful insights and trends in the data.

---

## Dataset:
The dataset contains medical data of patients including attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and chest pain type, among others.

---

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- pandas_profiling / ydata-profiling

---

## Key Steps Performed:

1. **Initial Data Inspection**
   - Checked shape, data types, and previewed records

2. **Missing Value Analysis**
   - Identified and handled null/missing values (if any)

3. **Statistical Summary**
   - Descriptive statistics of all features

4. **Univariate & Bivariate Visualizations**
   - Histograms and box plots for distribution
   - Correlation heatmap for multivariate analysis

5. **Insights**
   - Found key features that strongly affect heart disease (like chest pain, cholesterol, age)

---

## Conclusion:
This EDA helped uncover relationships and distributions among features that are linked with the likelihood of heart disease. It provided a strong foundation for future predictive modeling and feature selection.
