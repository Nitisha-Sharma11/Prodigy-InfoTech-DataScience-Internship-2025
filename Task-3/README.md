# Task 3: Bank Marketing ML Model (Additional Task)

This task is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
In this task, I built a machine learning model using a bank marketing dataset to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

# Key Steps Performed

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and converted categorical features using Label Encoding  
- Removed irrelevant or redundant features  

## Model Building
- Built Decision Tree Classifier using both Gini Index and Entropy  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification reports  

## Visualization
- Bar plots for class distribution  
- Confusion matrix heatmaps to visualize predictions

# Insights

- The model using Gini Index performed slightly better in accuracy and recall  
- Most clients do not subscribe to a term deposit (imbalanced dataset)  
- Duration of last contact had the strongest influence on prediction

# Conclusion

This task demonstrated how machine learning can help banks target the right customers for marketing campaigns. Decision tree models provided interpretable results and highlighted key features influencing customer decisions.
