# Task 4: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing – Student Dataset

This task is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
In this task, I focused on cleaning and preprocessing a student dataset to prepare it for effective data analysis and visualization.

---

## 📁 Dataset:
The dataset contains details of students including name, age, gender, scores, education, and interest area.

---

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy

---

## 🔍 Key Cleaning Steps Performed:

1. **Initial Inspection**
   - Viewed dataset shape, column names, and data types

2. **Missing Value Treatment**
   - Checked and handled null values using techniques like `fillna()` and `dropna()`

3. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Identified and removed duplicate records using `drop_duplicates()`

4. **Data Type Correction**
   - Converted columns to appropriate data types where necessary

5. **Renaming & Dropping Columns**
   - Cleaned column names for consistency
   - Removed irrelevant or empty columns

---

## 📌 Conclusion:
The cleaned dataset is now ready for further exploration and modeling. Proper preprocessing ensures accurate analysis and better results in downstream tasks.
