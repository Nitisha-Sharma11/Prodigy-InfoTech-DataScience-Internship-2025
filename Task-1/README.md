# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ World Population

This task is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a world population dataset to analyze demographic trends using visualizations.

  - `SP.POP.TOTL.FE.IN` â€“ Female Population  
  - `SP.POP.TOTL.MA.IN` â€“ Male Population  
  - `SP.POP.TOTL.FE.ZS` â€“ Female (% of total)  
  - `SP.POP.TOTL.MA.ZS` â€“ Male (% of total)

# Key Steps Performed

- **Data Import and Exploration**
  - Loaded the dataset and viewed shape, columns, and basic statistics.
  - Checked for duplicates and missing values.

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Removed any unnecessary columns and confirmed dataset quality.

- **Visualization & Analysis**
  - Bar chart showing top 10 most populous countries.
  - Area plots showing population growth trends (2001â€“2022).
  - Gender-wise population trends using line plots and color comparisons.
  - Observations on total, male, and female population growth across countries.

---

# Insights

- Clear rise in total global population over time.
- Gender distribution remains nearly equal in most countries.
- Some countries show more significant growth than others due to population policies, urbanization, etc.

# Conclusion

This EDA provided meaningful insights into global population growth and gender distribution trends.  
The visualizations effectively summarized how demographic variables have changed over the years.
