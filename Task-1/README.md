# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ World Population

This task is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a world population dataset using various visualization techniques.

---

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this task is **world_population_data.csv**  
It contains country-wise population data from the year 2001 to 2022.

---

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Key Steps Performed:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked and handled missing values and duplicates
   - Removed irrelevant columns

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Bar chart of top 10 countries by population
   - Line plot showing global population growth over years

3. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Area plots to show year-wise growth per country
   - Color-coded charts for region-wise comparison

4. **Insights**
   - Identified population growth trends
   - Visual comparison between countries and continents

---

## Conclusion:
The EDA helped in understanding how population growth varies across different countries and regions over time. The visualizations provided a clear summary of population patterns and highlighted the leading countries in terms of growth.
