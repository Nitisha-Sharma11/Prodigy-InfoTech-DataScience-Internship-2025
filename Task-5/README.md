# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

Welcome to my traffic accident data analysis project, completed during my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025).  
This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving insights from a dataset with traffic records.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to analyze traffic accident data to identify trends, hotspots, and patterns that inform road safety strategies and policy decisions.

---

## Dataset

This project uses publicly available traffic accident data from Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [US Accidents (Kaggle Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

The dataset includes attributes such as:
- **ID, Severity** (levels 1â€“4), **Time** (start/end)
- **Location**: latitude/longitude, street, city, state
- **Weather**: temperature, humidity, visibility, wind, precipitation, etc.
- **Road features**: crossings, signals, junctions
- **Time of day**: sunrise/sunset and twilight conditions

---

## Methodology

- Cleaned and converted data types for consistency  
- Handled missing values and duplicate entries  
- Conducted EDA to examine distributions, trends, and relationships  
- Created visualizations like bar charts, heatmaps, and maps to highlight insights

---

## Key Findings

- **Miami** had the highest number of accidents; **Star Junction** and **Stromsburg** had the fewest  
- **California** topped state-wise accidents; **South Dakota** had the fewest  
- Accident count peaked in **2021**  
- Most accidents were at severity level **2**  
- Majority occurred in **fair weather** and during the **morning**

## Summary

This analysis brings forward locations, weather, and timing factors that correlate with higher accident rates. These insights can guide preventive measures and road safety planning.
