# Task 5: Mini Project – Heart Disease Prediction

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook for **Task 5** of my Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech (June 2025)**.

## 📌 Description:
In this mini project, a machine learning model was built to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical features. The steps included data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 📁 Files Included:
- `Task5_HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the full ML pipeline.
- `heart.csv` – Dataset used for prediction.
- `output_charts/` – (Optional) Visual results like confusion matrix or ROC curve.
